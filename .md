This is a simple Node.js API that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers passed as query parameters.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
Node.js
 ## Running the API
Start the API by running the following command:
npm start
The API will be running on http://localhost:8000
## Usage
To use the calculator API, make a GET request to http://localhost:8000/calculator with the following query parameters:

operation: The type of operation to perform. Can be one of add, subtract, multiply, divide.
num1: The first number.
num2: The second number.
For example, to add 5 and 3, make a GET request to http://localhost:8000/calculator?operation=add&num1=5&num2=3

The API will return a JSON object with a single key result that contains the result of the operation.

## Error Handling
In case of invalid parameters or invalid operation, the API will return a JSON object with an error key and message.

## Limitations
This is a very simple example and it doesn't have any validation or error handling in place, you should add it in a production level implementation.

## Built With
Node.js - JavaScript runtime
Express.js - Web framework for Node.js
